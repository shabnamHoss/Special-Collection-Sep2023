    <div class="content-case9-1">
      <p>Augsburg. 1499</p>
      <p>From ancient times until the 20th century, the term materia medica was used to describe the substances and therapeutic properties of natural products used 
          for medicinal purposes. Dioscorides, a 1st century Greek physician, wrote the first extensive pharmacopeia, a work which remained in use for 15 centuries
          and is the ancestor of our leaf. This single leaf, printed by Hans Schonsperger, is a German version of the Latin Hortus sanitatis published in Mainz.
          The hand-colored woodcut on this leaf, though printed in reverse, can also be seen in the Wellcome Collection’s Herbarius. Notable features in this edition 
          include double columns for text and smaller illustrations, changes made to reduce the amount of paper needed to print the book. It’s difficult to identify 
          this plant even with the help of the caption on the verso of the leaf.</p>

    <div class="content-case9-1">
      <p>New York. 1888</p>
      <p>Many books on medical topics printed in the 19th century were published as schoolbooks. By 1850, instruction in physiology, hygiene, and physical training 
          were standard part of education curricula. All three of these illustrated texts include basic information about anatomy and major bodily functions but the books 
          produced in the 1880s emphasize the negative role alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics play in human health. This shift is due in part to the Woman’s Christian Temperance 
          Union support for state legislation requiring temperance instruction in public schools.</p>

      <p>In 19th century Tennessee, as was the case elsewhere in the country, doctors offering cures for every imaginable disease peddled their products and services. Mortimore was one of these.
        Tennessee didn’t require licensing of physicians until 1889 so potential patients had no way of verifying the credibility of the practitioner or the cure except through testimonials like the
        ones filling the pages of this pamphlet.</p>

      <p>Richard Walker and Rachel</p>
      <p>London. 2018</p>
      <p>Sixteenth century anatomy books were some of the first books to utilize movable elements, specifically flaps, which allowed the reader to “dissect”
          the body by lifting layers of skin and muscle to reveal the organs underneath. At first, these movable books were produced for a select circle of
          anatomists and physicians but by the 19th century, flap books were common teaching tools used by aspiring medical practitioners as well as laymen.
          Today, pop-ups add a new, three-dimensional element to popular anatomy books designed for children and adults. This Victorian inspired example utilizes unique,
          interlocking folded layers combined with simple flaps to create a complex, deep dive down into the workings of human physiology.</p>

    <div class="content-case9-1">
      <p>Rezin Thompson</p>
      <p>Germantown, Tennessee. 1860</p>
      <p>Early 19th century publishing in Tennessee included numerous examples of practical medical works. Although he doesn’t reference Samuel Thomson’s botanicism
          specifically, Carter was clearly a proponent of his plant-based, populist approach to medicine. If it is true, as Carter states in his introduction,
          that “the same earth which yields our food, produces our medicine,” then his book’s materia medica section and dispensatory with more than 200 recipes
          should prepare anyone with plain common sense to follow instructions and create their own remedies. Thompson’s Medical Adviser, like Carter’s work,
          addresses a broad audience but he drops the botanic emphasis and provides a much more substantive discussion of human diseases.</p>

      <p>The Warden Memorial Equine collection contains a plethora of work on horse health and well-being, but this small volume addresses the medical status of the rider, 
        not the horse. Exercise is an obvious benefit of riding. Durant goes further, explaining its salutary effect on circulation of the blood, respiration, 
        digestion, and perspiration. His list of diseases for which riding is therapeutic includes anemia, syphilis, gout, diabetes, and fever.</p>
